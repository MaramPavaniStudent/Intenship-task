To tokenize and preprocess data for fine-tuning a DistilBERT model using Hugging Face Transformers
We would typically follow these steps: load the dataset,use the DistilBERT tokenizer to convert text into tokens,and prepare the data for training.Fine-tuning involves training the model on your labeled dataset.
